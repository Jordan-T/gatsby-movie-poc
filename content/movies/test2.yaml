      <p>They don&apos;t make many Sci-Fi films these days. This was a
      pleasant surprise all throughout the film. I really like
      this film.</p>

      <p>Coming out of the theatres following my viewing of this
      film, I was confused. I couldn&apos;t decide whether I liked it
      or not.</p>

      <p>I have been a cinema lover for years, read a lot of
      reviews on SKRN and everywhere, and never found the right
      movie to write my first review. I always thought I would
      wait for the movie.</p>
      <p>And this is it!</p>

      <p>&apos;Oblivion&apos; was incredible. The visuals, the score, the
      acting, were all amazing. The plot is definitely one of
      the most original I&apos;ve seen in a while</p>
